### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a Physics and Computer Science double major at Bowdoin College, graduating in June, 2023. I have a background in math and Physics, and I apply it in coding projects, music, and even visual art. In the last few years, I have developed a passion beyond my academic coursework for coding, participating and leading projects that range from embedded processors to AI in financial trading simulations to full stack web development. Professionally, I started working for Marketron as a Software Engineering intern in May, 2022. I continue to work there part time, while finishing my Bachelors Degree.
