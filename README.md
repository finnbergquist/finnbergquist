### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Physics and Computer Science double major at Bowdoin College, graduating in June, 2023. I have a background in math and Physics, and I apply it in coding projects, music, and even visual art. In the last few years, I have developed a passion beyond my academic coursework for coding, participating and leading projects that range from embedded processors to AI in financial trading simulations to full stack web development. Professionally, started working  for Marketron as a Software Engineering intern in May, 2022. I continue to work there part time, while finishing my Bachelors Degree.
